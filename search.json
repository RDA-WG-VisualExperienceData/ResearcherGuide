    "section": "Selecting devices",
    "text": "Selecting devices\nThe first step in any project examining visual experience and light exposure is the choice of a device. This involves understanding the properties of different wearable devices, and several trade-offs. A recent survey found &gt;50 wearable devices differing in form and function (van Duijnhoven et al. 2025), indicating the need to make informed choices.\n\nMeasurement capabilities and sensor characteristics\nSpectral/photometric/α-opic metrics, sampling rate, uncertainty, cosine response, range, etc. (Spitschan et al. 2022)\nSpectral sensitivity functions (CIE 2018; Lucas et al. 2014)\n\n\nAdvanced and additional modalities\nSpatial resolution, movement tracking, UV/IR detection.\n\n\nManufacturer calibration\nDevices designed to measure light exposure and other aspects of the optical environment should come with information from the manufacturer on the calibration procedures used to ensure high-quality measurements. Sometimes, information for one exemplary device is included in a spec sheet or datasheet. It is worth consulting with the manufacturer on any calibrations they perform and specifically clarifying whether device-level information is available.\nThe manufacturer may also recommend recalibrations of the devices at regular intervals. It is worth understanding the rationale for any such recalibrations (in particular if they come at a cost), as well as any recalibrations that researchers themselves can do.\n\n\nSize, form, and design\nThe size, form and design of a wearable light logger are particularly important for the specific contexts in which it will be used. Devices that are too heavy, bulky or impractically shaped will likely not be of particular use in field studies on light exposure. The most common form factors are devices that are wrist-worn, lanyard-worn, attached with a clip, or attached to spectacle frames.\n\n\n\nForm factors and wearing locations\n\n\nDifferent form factors are susceptible to different types of occlusions, so beyond participant comfort, a device’s dimensions and intended use case are also directly linked to data reliability. As of 2025, no specific device can be used all the time in all contexts and provide reliable information.\nCommon problems include:\n\nWrist-worn devices are susceptible to being occluded by sleeves, particularly in settings or cold weather seasons.\nLanyard-worn and clip-worn devices are susceptible to being occluded by jackets or other outer garments.\nDevices attached to spectacle frames are impractical for long-term use in the real world.\n\n\n\nBattery capacity\nBattery life, charging cycles, power management.\n\n\nData storage\nStorage capacity, retention, and privacy.\n\n\nRaw data format and ease of use\nExport formats, transfer speed, and syntactic structure.\n\n\nWear/non-wear and occlusion detection\nSome devices may be able to detect whether they are being worn, either online, or after analysis using the manufacturer-provided software. For wrist-worn devices, this could be implemented through a capacitance sensor, or temperature sensor, or in conjunction with data from the IMU. Additionally, devices might be able to detect it is occluded.\nWhen wear detection is not available from the device-inherent capabilities, it is recommended that researchers investigate concise methods for estimating wear/non-wear state, e.g. through additional questionnaires or using a data-driven approach.\n\n\nInteraction with the device\nSome devices contain event buttons, which, when pressed, insert time-stamped information into the data log. This functionality can be very useful for determining wear/non-wear state and specific events taking place for the participant. It is worth noting that as they are a user interaction, participants are not guaranteed to do it consistently.\n\n\nDocumentation\nThe quality of manufacturer documentation can vary significantly, and it is important to consult the manufacturer on its completeness. This includes, at a minimum:\n\nSensor capabilities and calibration\n\nFull description of sensor capabilities, including calibration information\n\nTraceability of calibration (e.g., to national standards)\n\nDocumentation of validation procedures (e.g., lab vs. field performance)\n\nInstructions for user-performed recalibration and required tools\n\nExpected lifespan and stability of sensor performance over time (e.g., sensor drift)\n\nEnvironmental and operational conditions\n\nEnvironmental operating conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, altitude)\n\nKnown hardware/software limitations (e.g., maximum sampling rate, data loss risks)\n\nInformation on error states or error modes that may be encountered during data collection\n\nDevice behaviour and data processing\n\nDescription of any onboard data processing, compression, or classification algorithms\n\nDetails on how timestamps are generated and synchronized (e.g., internal clock behavior, drift)\n\nFirmware versioning and changelog history, especially for devices under active development\n\nData structure and output\n\nFull description of all data available from the device\n\nClear explanation of file formats (CSV, JSON, binary, proprietary, etc.)\n\nUsage and deployment guidance\n\nRecommended positioning and usage instructions to ensure data validity\n\nRegulatory and support information\n\nAny relevant compliance certifications (e.g., CE, FCC, ISO)\n\nContact information for technical support\n\n\n\n\nSoftware ecosystem\nFeatures for annotation, tagging, and version control.

    "section": "Designing the protocol",
    "text": "Designing the protocol\n\nClarity on the research question and pre-registration\nThe research question, hypotheses, procedures, and methods need to be aligned in a tight way. In measuring visual experience and light exposure, this alignment becomes particularly important due to the changing and context-dependent nature of light. Measuring a single day of light exposure to draw conclusions about seasonal effects is methodologically flawed, neglecting intra- and inter-day fluctuations in weather, behaviour and exposures. For more robust measurements, typically, longer measurements are needed and include data from weekdays and weekends. Additionally, different work schedules (Daugaard et al. 2019; Price, Khazova, and Udovicic 2022) and seasons at specific latitudes (Cole et al. 1995; Graw et al. 1999; Thorne et al. 2009; Ulaganathan et al. 2019; Dunster et al. 2023) can lead to significant differences in exposure. At the same time, coverage needs to be balanced with participant burden.\nIt is important to clearly formulate the research question, hypotheses, procedures, and methods before the data collection. An additional step is to write a pre-registration detailing the protocol and analysis plans.\n\n\nParticipant burden vs. fidelity\nBalancing precision with practicality.\n\n\nMeasurement capabilities matched to use case\nSimilar to how the research question, hypotheses, procedures, and methods need to be tightly aligned, the measurement capabilities of the wearable devices needs to be matched to the measurement context (indoors, outdoors). For example, a wearable devices might not be suited to measure light exposure below 10 lx. If the goal is to measure dynamics in nocturnal light exposure, the device would not produce robust information. Similarly, distance sensors operate differently in different conditions (depending on the sensor technology).\n\n\nMeasurement length and time intervals\nSampling strategy and battery considerations.\n\n\nInclusion of other data\nSleep, activity, and context. (Guidolin et al. 2024)\n\n\nBehavioral modification through wearing location\nDifferent form factors and associated wearing locations could be susceptible to different ways that participants behave. For example, wearing a device attached to spectacle frames may not be very suitable for public environments, workplace, or specific recreational contexts. Consequently, participants may change their behaviour in response to the visibility, intrusiveness, or comfort of the device, leading to reactivity—i.e., modifications in naturalistic behaviour due to awareness of being monitored.\nSuch behavioural adaptations can include reduced social interaction, altered outdoor time, or avoidance of certain activities (e.g., sports, commuting via bicycle). These changes may introduce systematic biases in the collected data, particularly if the device form factor is not well tolerated across all settings or participants.\nTo probe for such biases, it may be advisable to include a questionnaire or single open-ended question after data collection asking whether they perceived any changes in their behaviour due to wearing the devices."

This can be done by asking participants to repeat key instructions in their own words or having participants demonstrate how to wear, remove, and charge the device correctly. A printed or digital instruction sheet can be supplied for reference.\nAdditionally, if there are any known problems with the devices, these should be communicated to the participants.\n\n\nRecurrent compliance checks\nThroughout a measurement protocol, it could be helpful to implement regular checks to remind participants of key steps involved in the measurement, including charging. In case there is online access to the data, such as through clouds, it is possible to monitor light exposure instantaneously and remotely. This can bring several benefits, including the possibility of corrective action should a participant not comply to the study procedures.\n\n\nDevice settings\nA time-stamped and versioned standard operating procedure (SOP) document can help ensure the reproducibility of device settings when there are multiple operators setting up devices for studies. A key component is to ensure the same parameters, but also other configuration flags being consistently used for logging.\nLogging configuration, time sync, DST handling."

Importantly, there are no standard metrics for the analysis of light exposure data that have been robustly and reliably linked to outcome metrics. Given the lack of standard metrics, researchers must pay particular attention to analytic flexibility leading to inflated false positive rates in statistical analysis.\nDuration vs. intensity metrics.\n\n\nSpecial properties of light and visual experience data\nLight exposure data spans a wide dynamic range, mirroring the differences in possible environmental exposures from the scotopic to the photopic range of light levels. This means that data are usually considered in a log10-transformed fashion.\nAn additional statistical property of 24-hour light exposure data is that it is heavily zero-inflated, due to the lack of light at night, or light below the measurement threshold of the device.\n\n\nImplementation\nIt is recommended that analysis of visual experience data is implemented using programmatic tools, such as R, Python or MATLAB. LightLogR (Zauner, Hartmeyer, and Spitschan 2025) offers a powerful open-source tool available on CRAN for the analysis of light exposure and visual experience data."

Additionally, the rationale for device selection, protocol design and analysis choices should be explained.\n\n\nMetadata documentation\nThorough sharing practices.\n\n\nCode sharing\nThe code used to analyse the data is not just a byproduct of the research process, but a result by itself. There are several reasons to make code available under an open source license:\n\nThe work underlying the scientific results is shared sustainably for re-use and independent checking\nThe researcher community can benefit from the availability of existing and citable code\n\nCode can be shared as static files attached to the supplementary material of a published article, or on a repository, such as GitHub or Bitbucket. For GitHub, Zenodo offers an integration module such that when creating a release on GitHub, Zenodo creates a DOI, making the code citable.\nImportantly, when sharing code, it is necessary to select a license under which the code is available. Common licenses include the MIT License, which is permissive with respect to commercial use, and the GPL License, which is more restricted. Choose a License can help making an informed decisions about software licenses.\nCode reproducibility can be ensured through independent validation through CODECHECK (Nust and Eglen 2021).\n\n\nData sharing\nEthical and practical aspects.\nIt is recommended that when researchers submit their ethics approval request, they already include the provision of sharing data in anonymized form. It can be very difficult to impractical to share data after the fact or seek re-approval from the participants.\n\n\nMaterials sharing\nTo ensure the reproducibility of research studies, it is recommended to share the materials used throughout the study, including any instruction sheets given to the participant, survey questions used, as well as debriefing documents. For any digital materials, such as forms served on a survey platform (such as REDCap), it is recommended, that the materials are provided in a format ingestible/importable by the platform\n\n\nFAIR data\nThe FAIR principles state that data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, to make them easier to share (Wilkinson et al. 2016). Several points raised in this Researcher Guide are driven to ensure that visual experience and optical radiation data are FAIR, including standard file formats and documentation. Importantly, FAIR data guarantees that the collected data are used sustainably, and available well beyond the specific published research articles.\nData can be published as part of the supplementary material of journals. An alternative option is to add them as data packages to specific repositories, such as Zenodo or FigShare."
