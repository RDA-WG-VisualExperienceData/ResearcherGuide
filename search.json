    "section": "Selecting devices",
    "text": "Selecting devices\nThe first step in any project examining visual experience and light exposure is the choice of a device. This involves understanding the properties of different wearable devices, and several trade-offs. A recent survey found &gt;50 wearable devices differing in form and function (van Duijnhoven et al. 2025; with previous overviews in Hönekopp and Weigelt 2023; Danilenko et al. 2022), indicating the need to make informed choices about selecting specific devices. As there are no standard or reference devices, each device needs to be considered individually. The following sections provide an overview of the technical properties that characterise individual devices and distinguish them.\n\nMeasurement capabilities and sensor characteristics\nDevices differ in their ability to measure aspects of the visual environment. These differences arise from design decisions, choices of technical components and the specific use cases one that a manufacturer had in mind when making the device. Importantly, the manufacturers usually supplies a data or specification sheet for a product; the verification and validation of these aspects ultimately should also be in the hands of the users of the devices (Spitschan et al. 2022).\n\nSpectral sensitivity functions\nThe goal of wearable optical radiation and visual experience loggers is to capture aspects of the environment relevant to human physiology and behaviour. As such, for most use cases, light is of interest. Light is defined as optical radiation within the visible region of the spectrum (approx. 380 to 780 nm). The photoreceptors in the human eye are sensitive to different parts of the spectrum, and serve different functions. The cones enable vision of space, colour and motion under daylight conditions, while the rods facilitate rudimentary vision under dim conditions. In addition to these ‘canonical’ photreceptors, the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) encode aspects of the visual environment, specifically ambient light intensity, through the photopigment melanopsin. The specral sensitivities of the cones, rods and ipRGCs differ, and were standardized by the CIE in 2018 (CIE 2018; Lucas et al. 2014).\nThe International Standard CIE S 026/E:2018 (CIE 2018) prescribes the spectral sensitivities of the photoreceptors, and thereby also provides a key reference framework for quantifying light exposure with respect to human responses. Notably, the standard proposes the α-opic quantities, where “α” is a placeholder for the cones, rods or ipRGCs.\nA common quantity in light measurements is photopic illuminance [lux]. Photopic illuminance is a quantity that weighs the long- and medium-wavelength sensitive cones and corresponds, roughly, to the psychophysical sensation of brightness. Photopic illuminance is not the same as the light quantity related to the ipRGCs, the melanopic equivalent equivalent daylight illuminance (melanopic EDI), and therefore needs to be measured independently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWearable light loggers usually measure the quantities directly through a series of discrete sensor channels, or measure the spectrum of light and then calculate the relevant quantities (e.g. photopic illuminance, melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance). Importantly, it is not guaranteed that the actual spectral sensitivity of a channel in a device corresponds to the standardised spectral sensitivity of the photoreceptor. It is therefore worth either calibrating the spectral sensitivity, or prompting the manufacturer to do so.\n\n\nDirectional properties\nIrradiance and illuminance measurements are usually done in cosine weighted fashion: Light that comes directly from the sensor is weighed more importantly compared to light that comes from the angle. This behaviour follows a cosine function as a function of the incident angle. Each sensor has a specific directional sensitivity that needs to be provided by the manufacturer, or measured and characterised.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe directional properties of a wearable light logging devices are important in so far as in the real world, different scenarios have different spatial configurations. As an example, a light logger that only captured light in the central 20° of the visual world would capture limited information, and omit the light coming from, e.g. overhead light sources.\n\n\n\nAdvanced and additional modalities\nWhile most optical radiation and visual experience loggers measure light at a minimum, advanced devices also include other modalities by design. This includes optical radiation in the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) part of the spectrum, spatial information, distance information, and movement tracking.\n\nUV and IR measurements\nUV and IR measurements are interesting as they can enrich and augment the data set in different ways. Through the inclusion of optical radiation in this wavelength range, it may be possible to determine whether an individual spent time indoors or outdoors (as the UV radiation entering indoor spaces through usual window glazing is negligeable). Co-measuring UV and IR may also facilitate future-proofing measurements of hitherto unknown physiological responses to this part of the spectrum. As with the spectral sensitivity of wearable light loggers, it is key to ensure that the UV and IR responses measured by a wearable device are metrologically sound.\n\n\nSpatially resolved measurements\nThe visual world around us is rich in its spatial and colourful detail, and we do not live in a Lambertian integrating sphere with homogenous illumination. In turn, the retinal image and the ensuing information available to the visual and non-visual pathways of the brain is spatially structured. A measurement of visual experience therefore could also include spatially resolved measurements such as those from a camera. Cameras, of course, also need to be characterised and calibrated, and importantly, the dynamic range of the visual environment needs to be included in considerations.\n\n\nDistance information\nAs with spatial information, the world is three-dimensional, and as we shift our gaze from different objects or parts of the visual scene, our accommodative state changes. In previous studies, it has been observed that near and far work are determinants of myopia onset and progression, and therefore some devices include depth information, which are then aggregated.\n\n\nMovement tracking\nStemming originally from research into circadian rhythms and sleep-wake cycles, some light loggers have integrated accelerometers and inertial measurement units (IMUs). These can be particularly relevant to determine various aspects of wearing behaviour. As an example, when a device is placed on a surface and not worn, this will present as non-movement. The exact ability to determine wear state from this sensor modality depends highly on the sensor sensitivity.\n\n\n\nManufacturer calibration\nDevices designed to measure light exposure and other aspects of the optical environment should come with information from the manufacturer on the calibration procedures used to ensure high-quality measurements. Sometimes, information for one exemplary device is included in a data or specification sheet. It is worth consulting with the manufacturer on any calibrations they perform and specifically clarifying whether device-level information is available.\nThe manufacturer may also recommend recalibrations of the devices at regular intervals. It is worth understanding the rationale for any such recalibrations (in particular if they come at a cost), as well as any recalibrations that researchers themselves can do.\n\n\nSize, form, and design\nThe size, form and design of a wearable light logger are particularly important for the specific contexts in which it will be used. Devices that are too heavy, bulky or impractically shaped will likely not be of particular use in field studies on light exposure. The most common form factors are devices that are wrist-worn, lanyard-worn, attached with a clip, or attached to spectacle frames.\n\n\n\nForm factors and wearing locations\n\n\nDifferent form factors are susceptible to different types of occlusions, so beyond participant comfort, a device’s dimensions and intended use case are also directly linked to data reliability. As of 2025, no specific device can be used all the time in all contexts and provide reliable information.\nCommon problems include:\n\nWrist-worn devices are susceptible to being occluded by sleeves, particularly in settings or cold weather seasons.\nLanyard-worn and clip-worn devices are susceptible to being occluded by jackets or other outer garments.\nDevices attached to spectacle frames are impractical for long-term use in the real world.\n\nPrevious studies (Okudaira, Kripke, and Webster 1983; Jardim et al. 2011; Aarts et al. 2017; Bhandari, Mirhajianmoghadam, and Ostrin 2021; Wen et al. 2023; Mohammadian et al. 2024) have shown that while wrist-worn measurements are correlated with chest or head measurements, they are not related by a simple relationship. This follows from the fact that the wrist and eyes point in different directions in different planes.\n\n\nBattery capacity and charging\nDevices differ in their battery capacity, which is a determinant factor for the way that the devices can be used in the real world. The battery capacity is typically known by the manufacturer, but will depend on a number of factors, including the sampling intervals. Additionally, the way that a device is charged is of important for the specific use. Wearables can usually be charge through one of the following methods: A direct cable connection, an insertable battery, or a charging dock. As with any electronic device, there may also be varying capacities over the lifetime of the wearable, which needs to be considered. Some wearable devices also feature a ‘power down’ function which puts the device into stand-by mode, thereby avoiding deep discharging.\n\n\nData storage\nData storage capacity is related to the battery capacity: For high-frequency sampling, the storage will run full, and the data would have to be downloaded from the device. Additionally, the sampling frequency itself may also reduce the battery capacity due to repeated operations. The behaviour of devices with respect to data storage when failure of any sort occurs is core. For example, when a device runs full, it could respond either by stopping any further data intake, or by starting the recording from the beginning. Similarly, when a device loses charge/the battery is empty, the data could be lost. Understanding the exact contingencies of these failure modes can mitigate data loss.\nWhere the data are stored is important, not only for practical considerations, but also for privacy concerns. Some devices allow for or have mandatory synchronization through a Bluetooth-enabled connection with a smartphone. This needs to be considered in the context of research ethics.\n\n\nRaw data format and ease of transfer\nTo date, there is no commonly accepted data standard for data from wearable light exposure and visual experience loggers. As a consequence, manufacturers typically develop their own format, which are sometimes not well-documented. The consequence of this is that any researchers or research users working with these types of data will spend a considerable amount of time to write loading functions to wrangle the data. Within the graphical user interface (GUI) that is attached to a device, it is usually possible to export the data into a range of formats. The transfer speed for the data can be important in environments or use cases where fast analysis of data is important.\n\n\nWear/non-wear and occlusion detection\nSome devices may be able to detect whether they are being worn, either online, or after analysis using the manufacturer-provided software. For wrist-worn devices, this could be implemented through a capacitance sensor, or temperature sensor, or in conjunction with data from the IMU. Additionally, devices might be able to detect it is occluded.\nWhen wear detection is not available from the device-inherent capabilities, it is recommended that researchers investigate concise methods for estimating wear/non-wear state, e.g. through additional questionnaires or using a data-driven approach.\n\n\nInteraction with the device\nSome devices contain event buttons, which, when pressed, insert time-stamped information into the data log. This functionality can be very useful for determining wear/non-wear state and specific events taking place for the participant. It is worth noting that as they are a user interaction, participants are not guaranteed to do it consistently. Some devices also include a status LED that indicates the device state. It is important to inform the participant of the meaning of each of the possible states, and intervene if necessary.\n\n\nDocumentation\nThe quality of manufacturer documentation can vary significantly, and it is important to consult the manufacturer on its completeness. This includes, at a minimum:\n\nSensor capabilities and calibration\n\nFull description of sensor capabilities, including calibration information\n\nTraceability of calibration (e.g., to national standards)\n\nDocumentation of validation procedures (e.g., lab vs. field performance)\n\nInstructions for user-performed recalibration and required tools\n\nExpected lifespan and stability of sensor performance over time (e.g., sensor drift)\n\nEnvironmental and operational conditions\n\nEnvironmental operating conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, altitude)\n\nKnown hardware/software limitations (e.g., maximum sampling rate, data loss risks)\n\nInformation on error states or error modes that may be encountered during data collection\n\nDevice behaviour and data processing\n\nDescription of any onboard data processing, compression, or classification algorithms\n\nDetails on how timestamps are generated and synchronized (e.g., internal clock behavior, drift)\n\nFirmware versioning and changelog history, especially for devices under active development\n\nData structure and output\n\nFull description of all data available from the device\n\nClear explanation of file formats (CSV, JSON, binary, proprietary, etc.)\n\nUsage and deployment guidance\n\nRecommended positioning and usage instructions to ensure data validity\n\nRegulatory and support information\n\nAny relevant compliance certifications (e.g., CE, FCC, ISO)\n\nContact information for technical support\n\n\n\n\nSoftware ecosystem\nLight loggers as hardware are bundled with software that enable their use. Software functionality usually includes:\n\nSetting up the device for logging\nChoosing parameters for logging (including intervals, participant ID)\nLive read-out of the data\nInformation about device and battery status\nData read-out from the device\nData saving into proprietary and/or open text formats\nManual data annotation and tagging of data\nData selection and masking\nData analysis\nExport from analysis results\n\nA key consideration is the ease of use of these companion software packages, and their maturity. If simple errors in use can lead to data loss, that is undesirable. A further consideration is whether the software is available across multiple operating systems, such as Windows, OS X and Linux.\nAs the software packages supplied by the manufacturers are typically not released as open-source packages, the underlying functions, in particular those pertaining to data analysis, are not transparent. It is therefore important to always note down the software version if a given analysis is considered to be archival. Furthermore, it is recommended to keep an archive of the software installation packages or ZIPs, so that analyses can be re-performed with exactly the same analysis routines.\nGenerally, it is recommended that the analysis of light logger data is not performed with proprietary software, but with open-source alternatives (Zauner, Hartmeyer, and Spitschan 2025)."

    "text": "Validating devices\nOnce devices have been acquired, a key step prior to deployment in a scientific study is their validation (Spitschan et al. 2022). Validation ensures that the devices are performing according to specifications, measuring reliably, and delivering data that can be meaningfully interpreted .\n\nStandardized validation procedures\nStandardized validation procedures should be followed to evaluate the device’s accuracy, precision, and stability. Ideally, these procedures should be based on accepted metrological principles, using consistent methods and reference standards. The validation protocol should be clearly documented, replicable, and, if possible, aligned with relevant national or international standards.\n\n\nCross-comparison with reference measurements\nLight loggers should be tested against calibrated reference instruments or standard light sources to verify their measurement accuracy. These reference conditions could include traceable spectroradiometers or other laboratory-grade equipment. By exposing the devices to known light spectra and intensities, any systematic measurement errors can be identified and, if necessary, corrected or documented.\n\n\nInter-device variability assessment\nA simple and cost-effective method to characterize variability between devices is to place them side by side under an overcast sky (Markvart, Hansen, and Christoffersen 2015). Overcast conditions provide a diffuse, relatively uniform light environment, which allows the identification of measurement differences between individual devices. Substantial inter-device variability should be addressed through recalibration or adjustment before deployment.\n\n\nIntra-device reliability assessment\nIn addition to comparing different devices, it is important to assess the repeatability of each device over time. This involves repeated measurements under stable light conditions to verify that the device produces consistent results. Intra-device reliability checks can reveal drift or other issues that could compromise data integrity in longitudinal studies.\n\n\nEase of calibration\nFinally, devices should support straightforward recalibration procedures if required. Documentation from the manufacturer should describe how to recalibrate individual devices and what equipment or conditions are necessary to do so. This ensures that any detected deviations can be corrected efficiently, maintaining long-term accuracy of the measurements."

    "title": "Researcher Guide: Wearable optical radiation and visual experience loggers",
    "section": "Designing the protocol",
    "text": "Designing the protocol\nOnce devices are in hand, a key consideration is the design of a protocol for collecting optical radiation exposure and visual experience data. In the literature, research groups usually follow their own custom protocols, but recently, a standard protocol for one-week measurements has been published (Guidolin et al. 2024). The design and choice of the protocol should include the following considerations.\n\nClarity on the research question and pre-registration\nThe research question, hypotheses, procedures, and methods need to be aligned in a tight way. In measuring visual experience and light exposure, this alignment becomes particularly important due to the changing and context-dependent nature of light. Measuring a single day of light exposure to draw conclusions about seasonal effects is methodologically flawed, neglecting intra- and inter-day fluctuations in weather, behaviour and exposures. For more robust measurements, typically, longer measurements are needed and include data from weekdays and weekends. Additionally, different work schedules (Daugaard et al. 2019; Price, Khazova, and Udovicic 2022) and seasons at specific latitudes (Cole et al. 1995; Graw et al. 1999; Thorne et al. 2009; Ulaganathan et al. 2019; Dunster et al. 2023) can lead to significant differences in exposure. At the same time, coverage needs to be balanced with participant burden.\nIt is important to clearly formulate the research question, hypotheses, procedures, and methods before the data collection. An additional step is to write a pre-registration detailing the protocol and analysis plans, thereby ensuring intellectual clarity on the purpose and procedure of measurements. It is worth noting that this effort in any event has to be done, namely at the point of data analysis, and so firming up a pre-registration in advance simply frontloads this effort.\n\n\nParticipant burden vs. fidelity\nFor any research, participant burden is a key consideration. The desired biological quantity of interest is the retinal irradiance, whih cannot be measured, as only the retina can ‘measure’ it. The next best geometrical consideration is the near-corneal plane, which places a burden on the participant under real-world conditions and may even modify their behaviour (e.g., selecting out of social situations). A core question therefore is to what extent near-corneal measurements are necessary for the research question at hand. A pilot study can bring clarity on the uncertainty introduce by the use of, e.g., wrist-mounted vs. chest-mounted light loggers. For some research questions, including those where distance information is important, some wearing locations are nonsensical. For example, a wrist-worn sensor will not be able to measure viewing distance.\n\n\nMeasurement capabilities matched to use case\nSimilar to how the research question, hypotheses, procedures, and methods need to be tightly aligned, the measurement capabilities of the wearable devices needs to be matched to the measurement context (indoors, outdoors). For example, a wearable devices might not be suited to measure light exposure below 10 lx. If the goal is to measure dynamics in nocturnal light exposure, the device would not produce robust information. Similarly, distance sensors operate differently in different conditions (depending on the sensor technology).\n\n\nMeasurement length and sampling intervals\nThe measurement length, i.e., how long the protocol should last, and the sampling interval, i.e., how often measurements are taken, is partially determined by the battery and storage capacity of the device, and highly contingent on the research question. There is currently no knowledge on interdaily variability, and future research should characterise this carefully. Regarding sampling resolution, if the goal is to measure or approximate the retinal stimulus at high temporal resolution, then of course, 1-minute measurement sampling is not sufficient.\n\n\nInclusion of other data\nDepending on the research question, additional data can be collected alongside the wearable device. This includes, for example, daily logs of mood, sleep and other aspects (Guidolin et al. 2024), and can be implemented using smartphone apps.\n\n\nParticipant reactivity and inadvertant behavioral modification\nDifferent form factors and associated wearing locations could be susceptible to different ways that participants behave, a phenomenon similar to reactivity, in measurement leads to changes in the people being measured (French and Sutton 2010). For example, wearing a device attached to spectacle frames may not be very suitable for public environments, workplace, or specific recreational contexts. Consequently, participants may change their behaviour in response to the visibility, intrusiveness, or comfort of the device, leading to reactivity—i.e., modifications in naturalistic behaviour due to awareness of being monitored.\nSuch behavioural adaptations can include reduced social interaction, altered outdoor time, or avoidance of certain activities (e.g., sports, commuting via bicycle). These changes may introduce systematic biases in the collected data, particularly if the device form factor is not well tolerated across all settings or participants.\nTo probe for such biases, it may be advisable to include a questionnaire or single open-ended question after data collection asking whether they perceived any changes in their behaviour due to wearing the devices."

There are several aspects that need to be considered i nthe data collection process..\n\nBriefing of participants\nParticipants should receive clear instructions on\n\nwearing the device, including suitable contexts and situations (related to the durability and IP rating of the device)\nhandling the device when they take it off, including logging it\ncharging the device regularly (if necessary)\n\nTo ensure that participants understand the instructions clearly, it is recommended that a short comprehension check be included after the briefing. This can be done by asking participants to repeat key instructions in their own words or having participants demonstrate how to wear, remove, and charge the device correctly. A printed or digital instruction sheet can be supplied for reference.\nAdditionally, if there are any known problems with the devices (such as common mechanical failures), these should be communicated to the participants alongside mitigation strategies.\n\n\nRecurrent compliance checks\nThroughout a measurement protocol, it could be helpful to implement regular checks to remind participants of key steps involved in the measurement, including charging. In case there is online access to the data, such as through clouds, it is possible to monitor light exposure instantaneously and remotely. This can bring several benefits, including the possibility of corrective action should a participant not comply to the study procedures.\nCompliance related to usability can be probed and measured using specific questionnaires (Balajadia et al. 2023; Stefani et al. 2024).\n\n\nDevice settings\nA time-stamped and versioned standard operating procedure (SOP) document can help ensure the reproducibility of device settings when there are multiple operators setting up devices for studies. A key component is to ensure the same parameters, but also other configuration flags being consistently used for logging.\nLogging configuration, time sync, DST handling."

This is possible in almost all cases, with few exceptions for specific measurement devices. Ideally, data comes in a text-based, rectangular format, such as CSV (comma separated values). Rectangular means that each line of the file contains the same number of separators. CSV has the benefit that is is universally understood and can be interpreted even by technical novices, can be easily shared, and imported by software. Beware, however, that there are many dialects of CSV, often dependent on the locale of the researcher. Hierarchical data (e.g., metadata) often comes in a nested file format, such as JSON or XML. Effort should be undertaken to keep file formats as consistent as possible across different data sources and they need to be consistent within data sources (which can be a problem, e.g., after a device update that changes the output). Dates and times within files need to be handled with care and consistently as well. While deviations can be manually adjusted during data import, it is tedious, unnecessary, and error-prone work.\n\n\nAuxiliary data\nWearable data on its own – even if it is high fidelity from a measurement perspective – is often lacking essential information beyond light but about the environment and the participant, e.g., non-wear time, physical activity, or climate-based information. Auxiliary data is defined as time-dependent (i.e. time-stamped) data relevant to the analysis of light logging data but not collected through wearable light logger devices. Data sources include but are not limited to diaries, companion apps, and concurrent measurements.\n\n\n\nStandard directory structure\nThere are many ways to structure a data directory. Most importantly, it needs to be consistent, speaking, and well described. It is suggested to differentiate between data containing the whole group, or individuals. Further, continuous data (i.e. time-stamped data), can be contained in a sub-folder. Here is an exemplary file structure constructed from a real example.\n Project/\n    ethics/\n    data/\n        raw/\n            group/\n               demographics/\n               discharge/\n               screening/\n               ...\n            individual/\n               $ParticipantID/\n                     chronotype/\n                     continuous/\n                         health_monitor/\n                         sleepdiary/\n                         wearlog/\n                         wellbeingdiary/\n                         ...\n                     discharge/\n                     clinical/\n                         OCT/\n                         ...\n                     screening/\n    research_logs/\n        anomalies/\n    materials/\n        inperson_screening/\n        online_screening/\n        questionnaires/\n    output/\n        figures/\n        tables/\n        explorative/\n    participant_docs/\n    scripts/\n\n\nDocumentation of anomalies\nIt is good practice to instruct participants to report any issues occuring in the data collection, either through a specially provided log, or through ad-hoc emailing. Some wearable devices, for example, have a status LED, which the participants can be instructed to monitor and note down any changes. These anomalies should be collected in one file.\nSimilarly, necessary data manipulations need to be logged, e.g., when manually changing a datetime-format that was entered inconsistently by the participant or experimenter. The log can take the form of a simple CSV file. For example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nExperimenter\nFile\nManipulation description\nRationale\nAffected columns\nAffected rows\n\n\n\n\n2025-06-01\nJohn Doe\nindividual/\ndischarge/\ndata.csv\nchanged Datetime to standard format\nDatetimes were entered inconsistently\n3\nall\n\n\n\n\n\nMetadata\nMetadata is data about data. Domain-specific metadata ensures data is annotated in a consistent way across projects and research groups. For wearable light logger a metadata descriptor was developed that contains study-level, participant-level, device-level, and dataset-level information (Spitschan et al. 2024). Implementations of the descriptor are in active development and will facilitate the creation and application of metadata in analyses.\n\n\n\nPrivacy aspects\nFor any biomedical data collection, privacy principles relevant to the local jurisdictions need to be upheld (e.g. HIPAA, GDPR, …). Careful consideration needs to be placed on which aspects of data contain personally identifiable information. It is not clear whether visual experience and light exposure, or time courses thereof, constitute personally identifiable information. More research needs to be done to understand the identifiability of people from their visual experience data.\n\n\nLocale consistency\nLocale in computer software is a set of parameters that define how information is displayed and stored. The parameters cover language, region, and individual preferences. Locales are important because software, especially gui-heavy software like Microsoft Excel, interpret data based on a user’s locale: what is the decimal marker, how are columns separated in text files, what are datetime conventions, etc. More problematic, however, is that some software, even research-focused companion software to wearable devices, also save files with the settings defined by a users locale. This leads to a myriad of dialects in theoretically well defined text-based files, like CSV (comma separated values), thus making the FAIR exchange of data between researchers more burdensome. The most common CSV deviation, typical, e.g., for some European countries, uses a semicolon ‘;’ as a column divider instead of the eponymous comma ‘,’. Very likely, this is because the comma in this dialect is used as a decimal mark instead of the full stop ‘.’.\nWe do not necessarily recommend for a researcher to change their locale settings on research machines (although that would help). It is, however, important that researchers are aware of the nature and influence of the locale, and we recommend the following:\n\nAvoid wearable devices that store data based on a user’s locale without explicit prompt\nMake certain that whatever import routine is used for wearable data matches the raw files, and that there are no differences between the files. If this cannot be avoided, import files separately depending on the locale.\nAlways check the correct interpretation of text-based data in the software of choice, especially regarding decimals, column separation, and datetimes\nThe analysis software LightLogR provides import routines that are based on typical settings for wearable devices. This means that by default, LightLogR users do not have to take care about locale settings, exept when device data is stored with deviant settings. LightLogR’s documentation page for import will mention known deviations in file formats, and new ones can be reported.\nNever overwrite a text-based file with software that changes a files’ locale conventions without notice. Microsoft Excel is a common offender, as it seems to interpret foreign locales correctly, but switches to the user’s locale upon saving (if the user does not actively choose a different format). At best, this potentially fragments a study’s data base, if some files are opened and resaved (e.g., when removing a header or correct some spelling), while others are not. At worst, it will misinterpret a text-string, e.g. interpreting a value of ‘2.04’ as ‘2 April’, which will be stored in the text file as a date, e.g. as ‘02-04-2025’. This type of data corruption can be easily missed at first, only to be noticed during analysis, sometimes with no mode of recovery.\n\n\n\nRecommended conventions for datetime\nTimestamps for wearable data need to contain datetime information in a consistent, unambiguous, and machine-readable format. Because there are many time zones around the world, datetimes are a complex topic and need to be handled with care. A time zone should not be confused with the offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), although for any given moment, a time zone can be related to a specific offset. Time zones also include information about whether or not there is daylight savings, and if the offset changes (e.g., due to policy). This means that local time + time zone contains more information than local time + offset. Date, time, and datetimes are standardized in ISO 8601, and it is recommended that datetimes follow its conventions. A comprehensive description of the structure can be found here.\nAt the time of this writing (2025), most devices do not store the offset to UTC as part of the timestamp, which regularly results in ambiguity following switches to and from daylight savings. This ambiguity can be avoided if:\n\ndatetimes follow the conventions in iso 8601\ndatetimes are stored in UTC format with a known time zone, taken from the Olson/IANA databases."

    "text": "Maintaining devices\nThroughout data collection, devices need to be maintained to ensure that data remains reliable and the devices remain usable. This is particular important in the field, where we cannot control directly what happens with devices and how they are treated.\n\nInspection\nUpon receipt of a device from a participant, it is recommended to ensure that there are no obvious signs of damage, excessive dirt, moisture intrusion, or missing parts. Visually inspect the device housing, buttons, charging port, and any attached sensors or straps. If available, perform a quick functional check (e.g., power on the device, confirm data presence, test charging). Document any issues immediately and, if needed, flag the device for repair or cleaning before redeployment. It is recommended that this is kept in an inventory. Should there be major concerns, it is recommended to contact the manufacturer with a detailed report.\n\n\nFirmware updates\nFirmware updates are an important part of maintaining light loggers, as they may include bug fixes, feature enhancements, or security patches. However, it is essential to ask the manufacturer clearly what changes each firmware update introduces. For example, if a firmware update alters calibration factors or sensor processing algorithms, data collected before and after the update on the same device may no longer be directly comparable. Any firmware changes should therefore be thoroughly documented, with version numbers tracked alongside the data, and ideally tested on a small subset of devices before widespread deployment. Most light loggers include firmware version information in the supplied metadata of their data files, and this should be recorded systematically to ensure clear traceability. Maintaining consistent firmware across all devices helps preserve data quality and comparability.\n\n\nCleaning\nDevices and attachment pieces such as lanyards and wristbands should be cleaned between different participants. The manufacturer should provide cleaning guidelines to ensure compatibility with the specific device materials. In the simplest case, textile lanyards can be washed, while wristbands can be carefully disinfected using appropriate cleaning agents. For replaceable components, such as lanyards, it may also be advisable to replace them periodically to maintain hygiene and device integrity.\n\n\nMonitoring and correcting device drift\nOver time, sensors in light loggers may experience drift, leading to systematic errors in recorded measurements. To monitor for drift, it is recommended to perform periodic reference checks against a calibrated standard light source or reference device. These checks should be scheduled at regular intervals, for example before and after each data collection cycle, or after prolonged storage.\nIf drift is detected, corrective action may include recalibration, manufacturer servicing, or applying a correction factor to the data — but only if such corrections are well-documented and scientifically justified. It is also important to record any detected drift, the correction procedures used, and the relevant dates, to ensure transparency and maintain data integrity across the study."

    "text": "Analysing data\nFollowing data collection, data are analysed.\n\nData cleaning and preprocessing\nDepending on the device, participant compliance, and other factor, it might be necessary to invalidate some of the measurements recorded by a device. Reasons include aspects such as:\n\nout of range measurements\nnon-wear\ndevice occlusion\nrecordings outside relevant time frames\n\nDue to non-wear at times of day at which specific activities occur (e.g., showering, contact sports, swimming, …), light exposure data may be missing systematically. Data may also be missing if the light exposure falls short of or exceeds the sensor range.\nThe following sanity checks are recommended:\n\nVisualisation of raw time series for the available sensors\nVisualisation of histograms to identify distributions of data and outliers\n\nNon-wear, missing data, aggregation.\n\n\nExploration and exploratory visualization\nVisual strategies for time series.\n\n\nMerging data streams\nSyncing sleep, activity, and light data.\n\n\nAdding context to the time series\nChronotype, location data, etc.\n\n\nMetric selection\nTime-series of light exposure and visual experience data can be analysed using a series of metrics (Hartmeyer and Andersen 2023; Zauner, Hartmeyer, and Spitschan 2025). Importantly, there are no standard metrics for the analysis of light exposure data that have been robustly and reliably linked to outcome metrics. Given the lack of standard metrics, researchers must pay particular attention to analytic flexibility leading to inflated false positive rates in statistical analysis.\nDuration vs. intensity metrics.\n\n\nSpecial properties of light and visual experience data\nLight exposure data spans a wide dynamic range, mirroring the differences in possible environmental exposures from the scotopic to the photopic range of light levels. This means that data are usually considered in a log10-transformed fashion.\nAn additional statistical property of 24-hour light exposure data is that it is heavily zero-inflated, due to the lack of light at night, or light below the measurement threshold of the device.\n\n\nImplementation\nIt is recommended that analysis of visual experience data is implemented using programmatic tools, such as R, Python or MATLAB. LightLogR (Zauner, Hartmeyer, and Spitschan 2025) offers a powerful open-source tool available on CRAN for the analysis of light exposure and visual experience data."

At a minimum, it is recommended to include text on the following points:\n\nDevice-related properties\n\nManufacturer, brand and make of wearable device used\nWearing location\nSampling interval\nMeasured quantities\nCalibration information on directional sensitivity, spectral sensitive, linearity and range properties\n\nProtocol-related properties\n\nLocation and season of data collection\nTime zone and changes (e.g., daylight saving time)\nWearing location\nWearing duration\nInstructions given to the participant for wear context and non-wear behaviour\nCriteria for inclusion/exclusion based on wear time and compliance\nUse of prompts/reminders to ensure compliance\n\nAnalysis-related properties\n\nPreprocessing of data, including outlier rejection, binning and smoothing\nHandling of partial or missing data\nAnalysis routines and functions used\nSoftware and version used for analysis and open-source availability\n\n\nFuture work may formalise these recommendations in the form of a consensus checklist.\n\n\nDiscussion section\nIt is recommended that the Discussion section discloses various limitations arising from the choice of devices or protocols, such as the inability to measure visual experience in the near-corneal plane using wrist-worn devices. Additionally, the rationale for device selection, protocol design and analysis choices should be explained.\n\n\nMetadata documentation\nThorough sharing practices.\n\n\nSharing code\nThe code used to analyse the data is not just a byproduct of the research process, but a result by itself. There are several reasons to make code available under an open source license:\n\nThe work underlying the scientific results is shared sustainably for re-use and independent checking\nThe researcher community can benefit from the availability of existing and citable code\n\nCode can be shared as static files attached to the supplementary material of a published article, or on a repository, such as GitHub or Bitbucket. For GitHub, Zenodo offers an integration module such that when creating a release on GitHub, Zenodo creates a DOI, making the code citable.\nImportantly, when sharing code, it is necessary to select a license under which the code is available. Common licenses include the MIT License, which is permissive with respect to commercial use, and the GPL License, which is more restricted. Choose a License can help making an informed decisions about software licenses.\nCode reproducibility can be ensured through independent validation through CODECHECK (Nüst and Eglen 2021).\n\n\nSharing materials\nTo ensure the reproducibility of research studies, it is recommended to share the materials used throughout the study, including any instruction sheets given to the participant, survey questions used, as well as debriefing documents. For any digital materials, such as forms served on a survey platform (such as REDCap), it is recommended, that the materials are provided in a format ingestible/importable by the platform\n\n\nSharing data\nData should be made available transparently and openly. It is recommended that when researchers submit their ethics approval request, they already include the provision of sharing data in anonymized form. It can be very difficult to impractical to share data after the fact or seek re-approval from the participants.\n\n\nFAIR data\nThe FAIR principles state that data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, to make them easier to share (Wilkinson et al. 2016). Several points raised in this Researcher Guide are driven to ensure that visual experience and optical radiation data are FAIR, including standard file formats and documentation. Importantly, FAIR data guarantees that the collected data are used sustainably, and available well beyond the specific published research articles.\nData can be published as part of the supplementary material of journals. An alternative option is to add them as data packages to specific repositories, such as Zenodo or FigShare."
