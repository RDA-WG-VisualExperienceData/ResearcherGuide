    "section": "Selecting Devices",
    "text": "Selecting Devices\n\nMeasurement capabilities and sensor characteristics\nSpectral/photometric/α-opic metrics, sampling rate, uncertainty, cosine response, range, etc. (Spitschan et al. 2022)\n(van Duijnhoven et al. 2025)\n\n\nAdvanced and additional modalities\nSpatial resolution, movement tracking, UV/IR detection.\n\n\nManufacturer calibration\nDevices designed to measure light exposure and other aspects of the optical environment should come with information from the manufacturer on the calibration procedures used to ensure high-quality measurements. Sometimes, information for one exemplary device is included in a spec sheet or datasheet. It is worth consulting with the manufacturer on any calibrations they perform, and specifically clarify whether device-level information is available.\nThe manufacturer may also recommend recalibrations of the devices at regular intervals. It is worth understanding the rationale for any such recalibrations (in particular if they come at a cost), and also any recalibrations that can be done by researchers themselves.\n\n\nSize, form, and design\nThe size, form and design of a wearable light logger is particular important for the specific contexts in which it will be used. Devices that are too heavy, bulky or impractically shaped will likely not be of particular use in field studies on light exposure. The most common form factors are devices that are wrist-worn, lanyard-worn, attached with a clip, or attached to spectacle frames.\nDifferent form factors are susceptible to different types of occlusions, so beyond participant comfort, a device’s dimensions and intended use case are also directly linked to data reliability. As of 2025, no specific device can be used all the time in all contexts and provide reliable information.\nCommon problems include:\n– Wrist-worn devices are susceptible to being occluded by sleeves, particularly in settings or cold weather seasons.\n\nLanyard-worn and clip-worn devices are susceptible to being occluded by jackets or other outer garments.\nDevices attached to spectacle frames are impractical for long-term use in the real world.\n\n\n\nBattery capacity\nBattery life, charging cycles, power management.\n\n\nData storage\nStorage capacity, retention, and privacy.\n\n\nRaw data format and ease of use\nExport formats, transfer speed, and syntactic structure.\n\n\nWear/non-wear and occlusion detection\nSome devices may be able to detect whether they are being worn, either online, or after analysis using the manufacturer-provided software. For wrist-worn devices, this could be implemented through a capacitance sensor, or temperature sensor, or in conjunction with data from the IMU. Additionally, devices might be able to detect it is occluded.\nWhen wear detection is not available from the device-inherent capabilities, it is recommended that researchers investigate concise methods for estimating wear/non-wear state, e.g. through additional questionnaires or using a data-driven approach.\n\n\nInteraction with the device\nSome devices contain event buttons, which, when pressed, insert time-stamped information into the data log. This functionality can be very useful for determining wear/non-wear state and specific events taking place for the participant. It is worth noting that as they are a user interaction, it is not guaranteed that participants will do it consistently.\n\n\nDocumentation\nQuality of manufacturer documentation.\n\n\nSoftware ecosystem\nFeatures for annotation, tagging, and version control.

For any digital materials, such as forms served on a survey platform (such as REDCap), it is recommended, that the materials are provided in a format ingestible/importable by the platform.\n\n\nFAIR data\nThe FAIR principles state that data should be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable, to make them easier to share and reusable. Several of the points raised in this Researcher Guide are driven to ensure that visual experience and optical radiation data are FAIR, including standard file formats and documentation. Importantly, FAIR data guarantees that the collected data are used sustainably, and available well beyond the specific published research articles.\nData can be published as part of the supplementary material of journals. An alternative option is to add them as data packages to specific repositories, such as Zenodo or FigShare."
