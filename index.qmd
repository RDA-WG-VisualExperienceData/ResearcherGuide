This site will shortly host the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Research Guide. The Research Guide is authored by the [Optical Radiation Exposure and Visual Experience Data Working Group](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/optical-radiation-exposure-and-visual-experience-data-wg/activity/). The site is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites), a scientific and technical publishing system.
