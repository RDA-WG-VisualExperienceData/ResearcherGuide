   abstract = {Light profoundly impacts many aspects of human physiology and behaviour, including the synchronization of the circadian clock, the production of melatonin, and cognition. These effects of light, termed the non-visual effects of light, have been primarily investigated in laboratory settings, where light intensity, spectrum and timing can be carefully controlled to draw associations with physiological outcomes of interest. Recently, the increasing availability of wearable light loggers has opened the possibility of studying personal light exposure in free-living conditions where people engage in activities of daily living, yielding findings associating aspects of light exposure and health outcomes, supporting the importance of adequate light exposure at appropriate times for human health. However, comprehensive protocols capturing environmental (e.g., geographical location, season, climate, photoperiod) and individual factors (e.g., culture, personal habits, behaviour, commute type, profession) contributing to the measured light exposure are currently lacking. Here, we present a protocol that combines smartphone-based experience sampling (experience sampling implementing Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS ratings) and high-quality light exposure data collection at three body sites (near-corneal plane between the two eyes mounted on spectacle, neck-worn pendant/badge, and wrist-worn watch-like design) to capture daily factors related to individuals' light exposure. We will implement the protocol in an international multi-centre study to investigate the environmental and socio-cultural factors influencing light exposure patterns in Germany, Ghana, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey (minimum n = 15, target n = 30 per site, minimum n = 90, target n = 180 across all sites). With the resulting dataset, lifestyle and context-specific factors that contribute to healthy light exposure will be identified. This information is essential in designing effective public health interventions.},

With the emergence of wearable light loggers and dosimeters, research on real-world light exposure effects is growing. There is a critical need to standardize data collection and documentation across studies. RESULTS: This article proposes a new metadata descriptor designed to capture crucial information within personalized light exposure datasets collected with wearable light loggers and dosimeters. The descriptor, developed collaboratively by international experts, has a modular structure for future expansion and customization. It covers four key domains: study design, participant characteristics, dataset details, and device specifications. Each domain includes specific metadata fields for comprehensive documentation. The user-friendly descriptor is available in JSON format. A web interface simplifies generating compliant JSON files for broad accessibility. Version control allows for future improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Our metadata descriptor empowers researchers to enhance the quality and value of their light dosimetry datasets by making them FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). Ultimately, its adoption will advance our understanding of how light exposure affects human physiology and behaviour in real-world settings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Light exposure is an important driver and modulator of human physiology, behavior and overall health, including the biological clock, sleep-wake cycles, mood and alertness. Light can also be used as a directed intervention, e.g., in the form of light therapy in seasonal affective disorder (SAD), jetlag prevention and treatment, or to treat circadian disorders. Recently, a system of quantities and units related to the physiological effects of light was standardized by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE S 026/E:2018). At the same time, biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs) to capture personalized light exposure were developed. However, because there are currently no standard approaches to evaluate the digital dosimeters, the need to provide a firm framework for the characterization, calibration, and reporting for these digital sensors is urgent. OBJECTIVE: This article provides such a framework by applying the principles of verification, analytic validation and clinical validation (V3) as a state-of-the-art approach for tools and standards in digital medicine to light dosimetry. RESULTS: This article describes opportunities for the use of digital dosimeters for basic research, for monitoring light exposure, and for measuring adherence in both clinical and non-clinical populations to light-based interventions in clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Light plays an important role in human health and well-being, which necessitates the study of the effects of personal light exposure in real-world settings, measured by means of wearable devices. A growing number of studies incorporate these kinds of data to assess associations between light and health outcomes. Yet with few or missing standards, guidelines, and frameworks, it is challenging setting up measurements, analysing the data, and comparing outcomes between studies. Overall, time series data from wearable light loggers are significantly more complex compared to controlled stimuli used in laboratory studies. In this paper, we introduce LightLogR, a novel resource to facilitate these research efforts. The package for R statistical software is open-source and permissively MIT-licenced. As part of a developing software ecosystem, LightLogR is built with common challenges of current and future datasets in mind. The package standardises many tasks for importing and processing personal light exposure data. It allows for quick as well as detailed insights into the datasets through summary and visualisation tools. Furthermore, LightLogR incorporates major metrics commonly used in the field (61 metrics across 17 metric families), all while embracing an inherently hierarchical, participant-based data structure.},

Metadata standards are one foundation for the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles of data management. They facilitate data discovery, understanding, and reuse. However, the adoption of metadata standards in biological research lags in practice. Barriers such as complexity, lack of incentives, technical challenges, resource constraints, and resistance to change hinder widespread adoption. In the field of chronobiology, standardization is essential but faces particular challenges due to the longitudinal nature of experimental data, diverse model organisms, and varied measurement techniques. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that emphasizes simplicity and practicality: the development of README templates tailored for particular data types and species. Through this opinion article, our intention is to initiate a dialogue and commence a community-driven standardization process by engaging potential contributors and collaborators.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: In the past few decades, the prevalence of myopia, where the eye grows too long, has increased dramatically. The visual environment appears to be critical to regulating the eye growth. Thus, it is very important to determine the properties of the environment that put children at risk for myopia. Researchers have suggested that the intensity of illumination and range of distances to which a child's eyes are exposed are important, but this has not been confirmed. METHODS: We designed, built, and tested an inexpensive, child-friendly, head-mounted device that can measure the intensity and spectral content of illumination approaching the eyes and can also measure the distances to which the central visual field of the eyes are exposed. The device is mounted on a child's bicycle helmet. It includes a camera that measures distances over a substantial range and a six-channel spectral sensor. The sensors are hosted by a light-weight, battery-powered microcomputer. We acquired pilot data from children while they were engaged in various indoor and outdoor activities. RESULTS: The device proved to be comfortable, easy, and safe to wear, and able to collect very useful data on the statistics of illumination and distances. CONCLUSIONS: The designed device is an ideal tool to be used in a population of young children, some of whom will later develop myopia and some of whom will not. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Such data would be critical for determining the properties of the visual environment that put children at risk for becoming myopic.},

   abstract = {Light has many non-visual effects on human physiology, including alterations in sleep, mood, and alertness. These effects are mainly mediated by photoreceptors containing the photopigment melanopsin, which has a peak sensitivity to short wavelength ('blue') light. Commercially available light sensors are commonly wrist-worn and report photopic illuminance and are calibrated to perceive visual brightness and hence cannot be used to investigate the non-visual impacts of light. In this paper, we report the development of a wearable spectrophotometer designed to be worn as a pendant or affixed to clothing to capture spectral power density data close to eye level in the visible wavelength range 380-780 nm. From this, the relative impact of a given light stimulus can be determined for each photoreceptive input in the human eye by calculating effective illuminances. This device showed high accuracy for all effective illuminances while measuring a range of commonly encountered light sources by calibrating for directional response, dark noise, sensor saturation, non-linearity, stray-light and spectral response. Features of the device include IoT-integration, onboard data storage and processing, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled data transfer, and cloud storage in one cohesive unit.},

   abstract = {Ocular light exposure has important influences on human health and well-being through modulation of circadian rhythms and sleep, as well as neuroendocrine and cognitive functions. Prevailing patterns of light exposure do not optimally engage these actions for many individuals, but advances in our understanding of the underpinning mechanisms and emerging lighting technologies now present opportunities to adjust lighting to promote optimal physical and mental health and performance. A newly developed, international standard provides a SI-compliant way of quantifying the influence of light on the intrinsically photosensitive, melanopsin-expressing, retinal neurons that mediate these effects. The present report provides recommendations for lighting, based on an expert scientific consensus and expressed in an easily measured quantity (melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (melaponic EDI)) defined within this standard. The recommendations are supported by detailed analysis of the sensitivity of human circadian, neuroendocrine, and alerting responses to ocular light and provide a straightforward framework to inform lighting design and practice.},

   abstract = {Humans live in a 24-hour environment, in which light and darkness follow a diurnal pattern. Our circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the hypothalamus, is entrained to the 24-hour solar day via a pathway from the retina and synchronises our internal biological rhythms. Rhythmic variations in ambient illumination impact behaviours such as rest during sleep and activity during wakefulness as well as their underlying biological processes. Rather recently, the availability of artificial light has substantially changed the light environment, especially during evening and night hours. This may increase the risk of developing circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWD), which are often caused by a misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythms and external light-dark cycles. While the exact relationship between the availability of artificial light and CRSWD remains to be established, nocturnal light has been shown to alter circadian rhythms and sleep in humans. On the other hand, light can also be used as an effective and noninvasive therapeutic option with little to no side effects, to improve sleep,mood and general well-being. This article reviews our current state of knowledge regarding the effects of light on circadian rhythms, sleep, and mood.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Myopia (short-sightedness) is an emerging WHO priority eye disease. Rise in prevalence and severity are driven by changes in lifestyle and environment of children and young people (CYP), including less time spent in bright daylight and more time spent on near-vision activities. We aimed to systematically map the literature describing direct, objective measurements of the visual environment of CYP. METHODS: We conducted searches in Ovid Medline 1946, Ovid Embase and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in November 2024. We included primary research written in English on environmental/behavioural factors and myopia onset/progression in CYP 3-18 years. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts/full texts. RESULTS: We included 34 articles: 21 explored the association of indoor and/or outdoor light exposure and myopia and included light measurements, two near-vision activities, four both light and near-work, four time outdoors without illuminance measurements, and three light exposure based on meteorological data. Most measurements were carried out at the level of individual children, rather than the surrounding environment alone. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations in measurement techniques, there is evidence that reduced illuminance, less time spent in bright light and increased daily duration/sustained episodes of near-vision activities and reduced working distance are associated with increased myopia prevalence/progression.},

   abstract = {Our visual perception of the world - seeing form and colour or navigating the environment - depends on the interaction of light and matter in the environment. Light also has a more fundamental role in regulating rhythms in physiology and behaviour, as well as in the acute secretion of hormones such as melatonin and changes in alertness, where light exposure at short-time, medium-time and long-time scales has different effects on these visual and non-visual functions. Yet patterns of light exposure in the real world are inherently messy: we move in and out of buildings and are therefore exposed to mixtures of artificial and natural light, and the physical makeup of our environment can also drastically alter the spectral composition and spatial distribution of the emitted light. In spatial vision, the examination of natural image statistics has proven to be an important driver in research. Here, we expand this concept to the spectral domain and develop the concept of the 'spectral diet' of humans.},
